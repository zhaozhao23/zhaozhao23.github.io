I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D). I completed the Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2023. Before joining the UM-D, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the NUS from 2023 to 2024, funded by Centre for Offshore Research and Engineering.

My research interests primarily lie in the crosscutting field of statistics and engineering, including probabilistic design for civil infrastructures resistant to multi-hazards, physics and data co-driven structural reliability analysis, and machine learning algorithms for uncertainty quantification.

It is urgent to develop the risk assessment method and basic software of civil infrastructures under the action of multi-hazards. Major engineering structures such as long-span bridges and floating offshore platforms suffer from ocean waves, earthquakes, strong winds and rainfall and other hazards alone or simultaneously during their whole life cycle. Therefore, the establishment of a new probabilistic design method for civil infrastructures to resist multi-hazards is a frontier issue, that drives most of my research activities. Because real-world systems are quite complex, I try to solve these problems from the perspective of physical mechanism and data-driven analysis.
