I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan (U-M). I completed the Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2023. Before joining the U-M, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the NUS from 2023 to 2024, funded by Centre for Offshore Research and Engineering.

My research interests primarily lie in the crosscutting field of statistics and engineering, including probabilistic design for civil infrastructures resistant to multi-hazards, physics and data co-driven structural reliability analysis, and machine learning algorithms for uncertainty quantification.
